I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE TALK TO ME BUT IM ALWAYS NERVOUS AROUND STRANGERS OR FRIENDS THAT IM NOT CLOSE WITH Sory :( (This includes me not being good at starting a conversation andsometimes i may be akward or stupid I APOLIGIZE FOR THATT â˜¹)

I can get overwhelmed or uncomfortable so sometimes if you start talking to me I might go in menu or just randomly leave DONT TAKE THIS PERSONALLY PLS. Its just a thing I have occasionally. Also my social battery can be low so sometimes I don't chat (Mainly because I'm lazy to type or just dont rlly wanna talk)

If I say something that mightve made you uncomfortable PLEASE TELL ME so I can never say it again because I do not want to make anyone uncomfortable.

This may seem funny but I have this thing what I call The Tweaking Hour which is at like very late at night/midnight (11pm-3am) SOMEHWRE AROUND THAT TIME I MAY start to disconnect from reality I DONT KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT BUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT like Im starting to feel that im not real and may do strange stuff at those times So if you notice me acting strange PLEASE ignore that.

I can be slow and stupid soemtimes
